# Problem statment

The Problem: College students (especially computer science students) learn valuable skills during college that would make them eligible to do work that pays much higher than minimum wage. However, students rarely find or get jobs that take advantage of these skills, or that pay such high wages. 

Example: Many third year computer science students have taken multiple coding classes, as well as data structures and algorithms. This is typically enough knowledge to do entry level programming jobs, which can easily start at twenty to thirty dollars per hour. However, it is very difficult to find this kind of work, so most college students end up working low skill low pay work instead. 
Prior Solutions: 
Job Sites: Many job sites include part time work, and allow filtering to quickly find jobs that fit the criteria of the user. Freelance Work Sites: There are many freelance work sites out there like Upwork and Fiverr that let people post their skills and get hired to do work on their own time. 
Gaps in Prior Solutions: 
1) The part time jobs available on most job sites generally have degree requirements that college students cannot meet even if they have the skills needed 
2) The number of part time jobs listed on job sites is very low 
3) Large job sites include mostly jobs a big corporations that usually work on larger projects where it makes less sense to hire a college student 
4) Freelance sites usually take a large cut of the profits from jobs worked 
5) Competition if fierce on freelance sites, and there is a good deal of luck involved with becoming a popular freelance worker 
Question: How can college students with valuable skills find part time jobs that take advantage of their skills, and pay them accordingly?
