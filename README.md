# Problem statment

Statement 1: Existing job sites do not include a lot jobs that college students can take while in college.
For example, searching for job listing on most job sites leads to mostly full time positions.
Prior solution: Most job search sites have a filter for part time positions.
Gap in prior solution: 
Prior solutions job listings still often arent entry level positions. 
Even if they are part time, most positions on prior solutions still have hours during the school day. 
Also creates a lot of noise to sort through.
Question: How can we filter out the amount of noise and irrelevant job listings to get results relevant to college students?


Statement 2: It’s hard for students to communicate to potential employers what their existing skills are.
For example, a computer science degree does not communicate much information about the actual skills of a student.
Another example is that students who do not yet have their degree do not have any evidence of technical skills.
Prior solution: Existing recruitment platforms allow applicants to list their skills and achievements. For instance, Linkedin
Gap in prior solution:
Portfolios and achievements don’t always tell the full story of technical literacy.
Existing platforms don’t cater to college students specifically
Question: How can we properly communicate a students technical skill and abilities to potential employers?
Question: How can we build a recruitment platform that caters to college students in particular?
